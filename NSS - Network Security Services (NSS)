When you set up TLS encryption or certificate-based authentication, you must manage the certificates which are stored in a Network Security Services (NSS). 
You need to create the NSS Database for a Directory Server Instance, and stores the certificates in an NSS database in the /etc/dirsrv/slapd-instance_name/ directory.
