## File access privileges:
etc drwxr-xr-x --- these are the file access privileges. 

The first character d tells you that it's a directory and not a regular file. 
The next 3 characters tells you that the owner has write, read, and 'traverse' privileges on this directory. 
The next 3 are the permissions for group ownership. Anyone that belongs to the group has the privileges that are shown in these 3 characters. In this case, the r-x means that anyone belonging to the group can read and traverse the directory(s) but cannot write to them. 
The final three characters are permissions for anybody else. Here again this says that anyone can read and traverse directory(ies) but not write to them. 

## Chmod permissions (flags) explained: 600, 0600, 700, 777, 100 etc.. 
Permissions: 
1 can execute 
2 can write 
4 can read 

The octal number is the sum of those free permissions, i.e. 
3 (1+2) can execute and write 
6 (2+4) can write and read 

Position of the digit in value: 
1 what owner can
2 what users in the file group(class) can 
3 what users not in the file group(class) can 
*It is in 4 digits, but usually only 3 are used, so just append another 0 in front of the beginning of the number. 
Example: chmod 0759 file owner can read, write and execute, users in file can execute and read

## Linux
# _df -h_: List the directories and how much space they take up 

# awk. Basic format awk 'pattem {action}' input-file > output-file 
Meaning: Take each line of the input file; if the line contains the pattern, apply the action to the  line 
and write the resulting line to the output file. If the pattern is omitted,the action is applied to all line
Example: awk '{ print $4 }' tab1e1.txt > output1.txt --- This statement takes the element of the 4th column of each line 
and write it as a line in the output file: output.txt. 
by default, columns are assumed to be separated by spaces or tabs (so-called white space)

If the column separator is something other than spaces or tabs, such as a comma, you can specify that in the awk statement as follows: 
awk -F, '{ print $3 }' table1.txt > output1.txt
