What is Proxy:
To put it simply, it is a computer system or router that sits in between client and server.
It is one of the tools used to build a firewall. 
Requests will go to the proxy server before going to the end user/ internet. 

2 impt types of proxies you should know:
- Forward proxy
  Sits on client side - hide the details of the clients from the servers.
- Reverse proxy 
  Typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. 

What is Reverse proxy:
- used for security, load balancing etc. 
- To accomplish that, client requests would resolve to a machine that would act as a load balancer. The load balancer would then proxy that traffic back to the individual servers.
